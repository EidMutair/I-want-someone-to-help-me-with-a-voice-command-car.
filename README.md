I want someone to help me write a code for a voice-command car, but when it detects an obstacle in front of it, it stops. I have a code that senses obstacles and it works well, and another code that works with voice-command and senses obstacles, but it does not work well because it keeps showing me that there is an obstacle 0 centimeters away (Google translation). I used Arduino uno and motor driver shield l293d and 4 TT Motor and Ultrasonic Module HC-SR04 and Bluetooth module - hc-05
